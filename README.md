⚡ Electric Load Forecasting using a Hybrid ML/DL Model

This project aims to forecast short-term electric load demand using a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of deep learning and machine learning techniques. By leveraging time-series weather and load data, the system predicts future electricity consumption with enhanced accuracy, which can support utility providers in energy planning and grid optimization.

 📊 Dataset Overview

The project utilizes two primary datasets:
- **Electric Load Data:** 5-minute interval resolution
- **Weather Data:** 6-hour interval resolution (interpolated to 5-minute frequency)

 🗂️ Data Sources
- Publicly available datasets or utility-provided load/weather data
- Data range: 2020 to 2022 (Train: 2020–Mid 2022, Test: Mid 2022–End 2022)
- If You want to skip the dataset creation process while training you can download the dataset directly and strat from the training process

⚙️ Workflow

The forecasting pipeline includes:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Load and weather data scraped or downloaded
2. **Data Interpolation**
   - Upsampling weather data from 6-hour to 5-minute resolution
3. **Time-Series Resampling & Merging**
   - Synchronizing datasets for uniform frequency
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualization and statistical insights
5. **Feature Engineering**
   - Lag features, rolling stats, time-based features, etc.
6. **Train/Validation/Test Split**
7. **Model Construction**
   - A hybrid of deep learning and machine learning models
8. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics like MAE, RMSE, MAPE
98 **Result Visualization**
